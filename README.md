# Digital Collectibles (Clarity Smart Contract)

## 1. Project Title
**Digital Collectibles** – Minimal NFT Implementation on Stacks Blockchain

## 2. Project Description
This project is a simple Clarity smart contract that allows the creation (minting) and transfer of digital collectibles, similar to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Each collectible is unique and has its own token ID.

The contract is designed with **only two public functions**:
1. **mint** – Allows the contract owner to mint a new collectible for a specified recipient.
2. **transfer** – Allows the current owner of a collectible to transfer it to another user.

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to provide a foundation for creating unique, verifiable, and tradeable digital assets on the Stacks blockchain.  
This contract serves as a base layer for building more advanced NFT applications, such as:
- Digital art marketplaces
- In-game assets
- Event tickets
- Certificates and proof of ownership

## 4. Future Scope
- Add metadata support for collectibles (name, description, image URL).
- Implement royalty payments for creators.
- Enable batch minting for collections.
- Add marketplace features for listing and selling collectibles.
- Integrate with decentralized storage like IPFS for asset hosting.

## 5. Contract Address
`<To be added after deployment>`
